In this project, we aim to delve into the scope of concurrent programming in OCaml. In
order to study Coarse-Grained, Fine-Grained, Non-Blocking and other types of
synchronization, we will implement a linked list(PlainLinkedList.ml). We will assess these approaches in
terms of efficiency and effectiveness across multiple dimensions, such as execution
time, scalability and memory overhead. Through the insights gained from this study,
we aim to contribute to future related work on synchronization in OCaml. We expect
the project's outcome to provide valuable insights into optimizing concurrent
programmings strategies.
